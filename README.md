# DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYSIS
 IPL-Inspired Descriptive Data Analysis | Google Colab + Pandas + Seaborn
With IPL fever in full swing, I decided to ride the hype train (minus the expensive tickets) and dive into some player data â€” although not official IPL stats, I used a cricket-style dataset to explore the data science behind auction trends, player performance, and pricing insights.

ðŸ§ª This project includes:

Uploading and working with CSV files on Google Colab (no local install needed âœ…)

Using Pandas for data cleaning, filtering, and slicing

Seaborn & Matplotlib for beautiful visualizations

Handling null values and dropping unnecessary columns

Performing practical filtering queries like:

Which players hit more than 80 sixes?

Which young players got sold for more than 5L?

Price distribution using histogram

Insights on player age vs. auction price trends

ðŸ“Œ Skills practiced:

Descriptive data analysis

Real-time Jupyter/Colab coding

Visual storytelling with data

GitHub integration of Colab notebooks
